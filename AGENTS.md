# pi-acp (ACP adapter for pi-coding-agent)

This repository implements an **Agent Client Protocol (ACP)** adapter for **pi** (`@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`) without modifying pi.

- ACP side: **JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio** using `@agentclientprotocol/sdk` (TypeScript)
- Pi side: spawn `pi --mode rpc` and communicate via **newline-delimited JSON** over stdio

## Architecture (MVP)

### 1 ACP session ↔ 1 pi subprocess

Pi RPC mode is effectively single-session, so the adapter maps:

- `session/new` → spawn a dedicated `pi --mode rpc` process
- `session/prompt` → send `{type:"prompt"}` to that process and stream events back as `session/update`
- `session/cancel` → send `{type:"abort"}`

### ACP server wiring (modeled after opencode)

Use `@agentclientprotocol/sdk`:

- `ndJsonStream(input, output)` to speak ACP over stdio
- `new AgentSideConnection((conn) => new PiAcpAgent(conn, config), stream)`

## Implementation constraints / decisions

- Do **not** implement ACP client-side FS/terminal delegation in MVP. Pi already reads/writes and executes locally.
- Ignore `mcpServers` for MVP (accept in params, store in session state).
- Stream all pi assistant output as ACP `agent_message_chunk` initially.
- Tool events: map pi tool execution events to ACP `tool_call` / `tool_call_update` (as text content).

## Dev workflow (to be filled once scaffold exists)

- Install deps: `npm install`
- Run in dev: `npm run dev`
- Build: `npm run build`
- Smoke test (stdio): `npm run smoke`
- Lint/test: `npm test`

## Manual testing notes

Once the adapter runs, it should behave like an ACP agent on stdio.

Quick sanity test (example):

```bash
# Send initialize request via stdin (exact fields depend on ACP SDK version)
# echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":1}}' | node dist/index.js
```

For real validation, test with an ACP client (e.g. Zed external agent).

## Coding guidelines

- Keep ACP protocol handling in `src/acp/*`.
- Keep pi RPC subprocess logic in `src/pi-rpc/*`.
- Prefer small translation functions (pi event → ACP session/update) with unit tests.
- Be strict about streaming and process cleanup (handle exit, drain stdout/stderr, timeouts).

## Source control

- **DO NOT** commit unless explicitly asked!

## Client information

- Current ACP client is Zed
